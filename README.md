# Alteryx Inspire 2018 Talk

## Taking Care of Model Deployment

This repo holds the code and slides for a talk that I gave at the Alteryx Inspire 2018 conference about
deploying a Python model to Alteryx Promote

In this repo, you'll find the Jupyter notebook that I used to train the model along with the code to
deploy the model to Promote from Python.

Also in here is an example application built with Node.js and React

To train use the Jupyter notebook, you'll need the dataset (~600MB). There's a script in the `/data` folder to get the file and unzip it.

- `cd data`
- `./get_data.sh`

Enjoy!
