# Alteryx Inspire 2018 Talk

## Taking Care of Model Deployment

This repo holds the code and slides for a talk that I gave at the Alteryx Inspire 2018 conference about
deploying models to Alteryx Promote

In this repo, you'll find the jupyter notebook that I used to train the model along with the code to
deploy the model to Promote from python.

Also in here is an example application build with Node.js and React

Enjoy!
